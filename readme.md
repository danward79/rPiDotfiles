# My rPi dotfiles...

This is a repo of the dot files used for my pi devices. Except my .private keys.

This [guide](https://dotfiles.github.io) really helped as did [this](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789#.qmgph96y5)

## To install
Clone repo
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/danward79/.dotfiles.git && cd .dotfiles
```
then ...
``` bash
./install.sh
```

Private/Secret keys are stored in the .private file in the private file.
